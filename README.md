# vs2015-binding-update-script
Small script to update the binding redirects for visual studio 2015 after update one, based on the instructions from Sergey Tihon.

I didnt read his blog post properly and discovered for myself that the binding gets reset if you install any extensions and updates, hence why I wrote this linqpad script so that I can quickly reset it (them) each time. See Sergey's blogpost below.
